title: Rich Text
---

In YAMLResume, you're not limited to plain text. The `summary` fields across
different sections (like `work`, `education`, `projects`, etc.), support a
limited set of [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax to
allow for rich text formatting. This enables you to create more expressive and
readable resume content.

## Supported Syntax

Here's a quick rundown of the Markdown features you can use:

### Bold and Italic

You can emphasize text using bold or italic styling.

-   **Bold:** `**your bold text**`
-   **Italic:** `*your italic text*`
-   **Both:** `***your bold and italic text***`

### Links

You can embed hyperlinks within your text.

-   **Syntax:** `[link text](https://example.com)`

### Lists

Both ordered and unordered lists are supported, including nesting.

<Callout title="Understanding the `|` character for multi-line strings in YAML">
  The `|` (pipe) character in YAML is used to create a "literal block scalar,"
  which is a way to write [multi-line
  strings](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21699210/2310396) while preserving
  newlines. This is particularly useful for fields like `summary` where you
  might want to include lists or paragraphs. Everything indented under the `|`
  will be treated as a single string, with line breaks maintained.
</Callout>

#### Unordered Lists

Use a hyphen (`-`) or an asterisk (`*`) for each list item.

```yml lineNumbers
summary: |
  - First item
  - Second item
  - Third item
```

#### Ordered Lists

Use numbers followed by a period for ordered lists.

```yml lineNumbers
summary: |
  1. First item
  2. Second item
  3. Third item
```

#### Nested Lists

You can indent lists to create nested structures.

```yml lineNumbers
summary: |
  - Team player with a detail-oriented mindset.
  - Experienced in databases (SQL, NoSQL).
    - Proficient in PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
    - Familiar with Redis for caching.
  - Strong foundation in data structures and algorithms.
```

## A Complete Example

Here is a `summary` field from a `work` entry that combines several of the
supported syntax features:

```yml lineNumbers
---
content:
  basics:
    # ...
    summary: |
      This is a sample YAML resume that support limited set of markdown rich text syntax (bold, italics, links, lists):

      - Computer Science major with **strong foundation** in data structures, *algorithms*, and software development
        1. Pixel perfect full stack web developer, specialised in creating high-quality, visually appealing websites
        2. Experiened in databases (SQL, NoSQL), familiar with server-side technologies ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), Express, etc.)
      - Team player, with detail-oriented mindset and a keen eye for design and user experiences

## What's Not Supported?

YAMLResume only supports the syntax listed above. Other common Markdown features
such as headings, blockquotes, images, horizontal rules, and tables are **not
supported and will be ignored during processing**.
