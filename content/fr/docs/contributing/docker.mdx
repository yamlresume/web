Besides the [CLI package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yamlresume), YAMLResume
also provides a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/yamlresume/yamlresume)
for easy onboarding.

As we've [documented](/docs/installation#docker-users), you can run yamlresume
docker container with the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app yamlresume/yamlresume <command>
```

However if you are interested, you can customize the Docker image to suit your
needs.

## Build Docker Image

YAMLResume's Docker image is defined and generated in two phases:

### Dockerfile.base

[Dockerfile.base](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/blob/main/Dockerfile.base)
contains the base environment for running YAMLResume, including all
necessary dependencies like [XeTeX](/docs/installation#xetex) from [TeX
Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) and [Google Noto
Font](/docs/installation#google-noto).

This is a base image mostly used for accelerating the build process on Github
Actionsâ€”installing texlive by `apt install texlive-xetex` thing takes about [30
minutes](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/actions/runs/15438395862),
which is too long to run for every docker build, so that we decided to build and
[publish this base image
once](https://hub.docker.com/r/yamlresume/yamlresume-base) and re-use this for
every further build.

Generally you don't need to build this image yourself, you can just reuse
the published image on dockerhub.

### Dockerfile

[Dockerfile](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/blob/main/Dockerfile)
defined how `yamlresume/yamlresume` image is built, it is very simple and
straightforward, just installed `yamlresume` from npmjs by `npm install -g
yamlresume@latest` and create necessary users and groups as per Docker's
[security best
practices](https://www.docker.com/blog/understanding-the-docker-user-instruction/).

Building the yamlresume image locally is a trivial task. You just need to run

```bash
docker build -t yamlresume/yamlresume .
```

You may need to take a look at [docker multi-platform
build](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/) if you, for example, run
into issues building docker images for different architectures.

I wrote [some tips on
X](https://x.com/xiaohanyu1988/status/1931178628785778722), you can take a look
if you are interested.
