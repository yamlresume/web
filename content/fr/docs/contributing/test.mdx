To have a smooth development experience, it is important to have a
solid testing strategy in place. This includes unit tests, integration tests,
and end-to-end tests to ensure that all aspects of the application are
functioning as expected.

## Unit Test

You can run unit tests using the following command:

```bash
# run tests for yamlresume/cli package
pnpm cli test

# run tests for yamlresume/core package
pnpm core test

# run tests for all packages
pnpm test
```

If you're working on a new feature, you can run tests on file changes:

```bash
# watch and test for changes in yamlresume/cli package
pnpm cli test:watch

# watch and test for changes in yamlresume/core package
pnpm core test:watch

# watch and test for changes in all packages
pnpm test:watch
```

<Callout>
  Don't forget to [build](./contributing/cli#yamlresumecore-build)
  `yamlresume/core` package if you are working on a CLI feature that depends on
  `yamlresume/core` package.
</Callout>

## Test Coverage

YAMLResume keeps a **[100% unit test
coverage](https://app.codecov.io/gh/yamlresume/yamlresume)** in order to pursue
high code quality and prevent regressions. You can check the test coverage
report by running:

```bash
# check test coverage for yamlresume/cli package
pnpm cli test:cov

# check test coverage for yamlresume/core package
pnpm core test:cov

# check test coverage for all packages
pnpm test:cov
```
