title: Layout
---

The core of a resume is the content, but the layout is also important. Lots of
JSON/YAML based resume generators only focus on the content, leaving the
layout untouched, which leaves a big problem for the user.

Unlike other resume generators, YAMLResume provides an opinionated layout
solution out of the box , which allows users to focus on the content of the
resume while generate professional looking resumes with pixel perfect layout and
typesetting.

Here is an example of layout configuration in a `resume.yml` file:

```yml lineNumbers title="resume.yml"
---
content:
  # ...

layout:
  locale:
    language: en
  margins:
    top: 2.5cm
    left: 1.5cm
    right: 1.5cm
    bottom: 2.5cm
  page:
    showPageNumbers: true
  template: moderncv-banking
  typography:
    fontSize: 11pt
```

## Locale

The `locale` option allows you to specify the language for your resume. This
will affect the date format, and other locale-specific settings.

```yml lineNumbers
layout:
  locale:
    language: en
```

Take a look at the [multi languages](/docs/content/multi-languages) for more
details.

## Margins

The `margins` option allows you to customize the page margins.

```yml lineNumbers
layout:
  margins:
    top: 2.5cm
    left: 1.5cm
    right: 1.5cm
    bottom: 2.5cm
```

## Page

The `page` option allows you to customize the page settings, such as the paper
size and whether to show page numbers.

```yml lineNumbers
layout:
  page:
    showPageNumbers: true
```

## Sections

The `sections` option allows you to customize the section titles and their
order. For more information, see the [sections documentation](./layout/sections).

```yml lineNumbers
layout:
  sections:
    aliases:
      work: "Professional Experience"
      education: "Education"
      skills: "Skills"
    order:
      - basics
      - work
      - education
```


## Template

The `template` option allows you to choose from a variety of templates. Each
template has a unique design and layout. You can find a list of available
templates in the [templates documentation](./layout/templates).

```yml lineNumbers
layout:
  template: moderncv-banking
```

## Typography

The `typography` option allows you to customize font styles used in your resume.

Currently, only `fontSize` is supported, and the LaTeX engine only supports
`10pt`, `11pt`, and `12pt`.

```yml lineNumbers
layout:
  typography:
    fontSize: 11pt
```
