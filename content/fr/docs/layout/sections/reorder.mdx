title: Reorder
---

By default, YAMLResume arranges sections in a standard order. However, you can
easily change this by providing a custom `order` list. This allows you to
highlight your most important information first.

## How to Use

For example, if you want to place your "Skills" and "Projects" sections before
your "Work" experience, you can define the order like this:

```yml lineNumbers title="resume.yml"
---
content:
  # ...

layout:
  sections:
    order:
      - skills
      - projects
      - work
```

Any sections included in the `order` list will appear first, in the sequence
you've specified. Sections not included in the list will be appended after,
following their default order.

## Examples

### Prioritize Work Experience

```yml lineNumbers
layout:
  sections:
    order:
      - work
      - education
```

Result: work experience appears first, followed by education, then all other
sections in default order.

### Highlight Skills and Languages

```yml lineNumbers
layout:
  sections:
    order:
      - skills
      - languages
      - work
```

Result: skills and languages appear prominently at the top, followed by work
experience, then remaining sections.

### Academic Focus

```yml lineNumbers
layout:
  sections:
    order:
      - education
      - publications
      - awards
      - certificates
```

Result: academic sections appear first, followed by other sections in default
order.

## Default Section Order

When no custom order is specified, sections are rendered in this default order:

1. `basics` (by default rendered to the top of the resume as a summary section)
2. `education`
3. `work`
4. `languages`
5. `skills`
6. `awards`
7. `certificates`
8. `publications`
9. `references`
10. `projects`
11. `interests`
12. `volunteer`

## Implementation Details

- **Priority**: Sections specified in `order` appear first in the specified
  sequence
- **Fallback**: Remaining sections follow in the default order
- **Deduplication**: Duplicate sections in the order array are deduplicated
  (first occurrence kept)
- **Empty Sections**: Sections with no content are automatically filtered out
- **Flexibility**: Users can specify any subset of orderable sections

## Orderable Sections

The following sections can be reordered:

- `basics`
- `education`
- `work`
- `volunteer`
- `awards`
- `certificates`
- `publications`
- `skills`
- `languages`
- `interests`
- `references`
- `projects`
