YAMLResume provides a set of tools to help you create, convert and manage your
resumes more efficiently. Here are some of the key utilities available:

## create-yamlresume

[create-yamlresume](./ecosystem/create-yamlresume) makes it easy to start a new
YAMLResume project with a one-liner command. It will scaffold your project
directory, installs necessary dependencies, and generates a sample resume file
so you can get started right away.

- Scaffold a new project with `npx create-yamlresume my-resume` or similar
  commands for `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`.
- Includes a ready-to-use project structure, scripts for building and validating
  resumes, and a sample YAML resume file.

## json2yamlresume

[json2yamlresume](./ecosystem/json2yamlresume) is a CLI tool for converting
[JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) files to the YAMLResume format.

- Converts JSON Resume files to YAMLResume, transforming fields and structure as
  needed.
- Ensures your data is validated against the YAMLResume schema.

These tools help you migrate from other formats, automate project setup, and
streamline your workflow with YAMLResume.
