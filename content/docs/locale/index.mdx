YAMLResume is designed to support multi languages out of the box.

Technically, there are two categories of things to do when supporting multi
languages:

- **[Internationalization](https://phrase.com/blog/posts/internationalization-vs-localization/#what-is-internationalization-i18n)**:
  often abbreviated as "i18n" (where the number 18 represents the 18 characters
  between "i" and "n"), is basically a set of practices that allow a product
  support multi languages, i18n main consists of translating the product into
  mutli languages and dynamically switching the language according to the user's
  choice
- **[Localization](https://phrase.com/blog/posts/internationalization-vs-localization/#what-is-localization-l10n)**:
  often abbreviated as "l10n" (the number 10 represents the characters between
  "l" and "n"), it goes beyond mere translation and instead adapts the product
  to the cultural specifics of the target language.

In practice, i18n always comes first, l10n comes after.

For all supported languages, we have the following concerns from a design and
implementation perspective:

- **[Linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics)**: the theorectical
  side of a language, including but not limited to the language's character set,
  syntax and grammar, history, etc.
- **Idioms**: common conventions and idioms that are generally followed by a
  language.
- **[Typesetting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting)**: best typesetting
  practices often followed by a language, such as italics, text figures, font
  style, kerning, ligature, etc.
- **Translations**: mere translations for a fixed set of terms and
  options used by resumes generated by YAMLResume.

## Supported Languages

You can use `yamlresume languages list` to list all supported languages. At the
time of writing, YAMLResume supports the following languages:

```console
$ yamlresume languages list

| locale.language | Language Name                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| en              | English                         |
| zh-hans         | Simplified Chinese              |
| zh-hant-hk      | Traditional Chinese (Hong Kong) |
| zh-hant-tw      | Traditional Chinese (Taiwan)    |
| es              | Spanish                         |
| fr              | French                          |

## Glossaries

We have used the following glossaries throughout this section:

- **Latin script languages**: languages that use
  [Latin script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_script) as the [writing
  systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system). Most [germanic
  languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages), [romance
  languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages) and many other
  languages like
  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language)
  use Latin script as the primary writing system.
- **[CJK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_characters)**: Chinese, Japanese and
  Korean languages.
- **[Character Set](https://www.creatopy.com/blog/what-is-a-character-set/)**:

- **[Justification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_alignment#Justified)**:
  the alignment of text within a block so that it is flush with both the left

  and letters, creating a uniform appearance across each line of text.
- **[Kerning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerning)**: the process of adjusting
  the spacing between characters in a proportional font, usually to achieve a
  visually pleasing result.
