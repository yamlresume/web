title: JSON Schema

## Overview

YAMLResume provides an official [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org) for
validating resume data.

The latest official JSON Schema is hosted at:
[https://yamlresume.com/schema.json](https://yamlresume.com/schema.json).
However, if you want a cut-down version for your IDE/editor, you can also use
the canary version
[schema.json](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/blob/main/packages/core/src/schema/schema.json)
from our GitHub repo.

Meanwhile, as YAMLResume evolves, the official JSON Schema will be updated
constantly, hence we also provide all archived version of the JSON Schema at:
`https://yamlresume.com/schemas/<version>/schema.json`.

For now we have archived versions for:

- [v0.10.1](/schemas/v0.10.1/schema.json)
- [v0.10.0](/schemas/v0.10.0/schema.json)
- [v0.9.1](/schemas/v0.9.1/schema.json)
- [v0.8.0](/schemas/v0.8.0/schema.json)
- [v0.7.5](/schemas/v0.7.5/schema.json)
- [v0.7.0](/schemas/v0.7.0/schema.json)
- [v0.6.0](/schemas/v0.6.0/schema.json)
- [v0.5.1](/schemas/v0.5.1/schema.json)

## What is JSON Schema?

[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org) is a JSON-based format for defining the
structure of JSON data. It is a powerful tool for validating and documenting
JSON data.

JSON Schema allows you to specify the expected structure, types, and constraints
of your JSON data. With JSON Schema, you can define which properties are
required, what types of values are allowed (such as strings, numbers, arrays, or
objects), and even set rules for value formats (like email addresses or URLs).

By using JSON Schema, developers and tools can automatically validate JSON data
to ensure it matches the expected format before processing. This helps catch
errors early, improves data quality, and enables features like auto-completion
and inline documentation in modern code editors.

JSON Schema is widely supported and can be used for configuration files, API
payloads, and, in the case of YAMLResume, for validating resume data to ensure
consistency and correctness.

## Benefits

Integrating YAMLResume's JSON Schema into your IDE/editor when crafting resumes
brings several benefits:

- **Auto Completion:** When you start typing, your IDE/editor will suggest
  properties and their expected types, helping you draft your resume faster and
  with fewer errors.

- **Format Validation:** Your IDE/editor will highlight any formatting errors
  (like invalid dates or URLs) as you type, preventing you from submitting
  incorrect information.

- **Property Docs:** Get inline documentation for each property,
  explaining its purpose, allowed values, and any special formatting
  requirements.

### Auto Completion

All [enum types](/docs/compiler/types#enum-types) will be
auto completed when typing. You can just type the first few letters of the option
and the IDE/editor will suggest a list of valid options, then you can just use
up/down arrow keys to select the correct one.

### Format Validation

Each key value pair will be validated in real time against the predefined
schema. You IDE/editor will warn you with precise error message to help avoid
low-level mistakes like wrong email format, invalid degree options, typos in
language fluency levels, etc.

<video
  autoPlay
  controls
  loop
  muted
  src="/static/videos/docs/compiler/schema/json/json-schema-format-validation-field-error.mp4"
/>

And if a required key is missing, the warning message will be escalated to its parent
object by default, so you can easily find the missing key.

  src="/static/videos/docs/compiler/schema/json/json-schema-format-validation-object-error.mp4"
/>

### Property Docs

Last but not least, you can get inline documentation for each property,
explaining its purpose, allowed values, and any special formatting requirements.
You can hover over the either the property key or the value to see the docs.

## How to use JSON Schema?

You need to install
[yaml-language-server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server)
to use YAMLResume's JSON schema for your resumes. Depending on your
IDE/editor, you may need to install different
[extensions](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server?tab=readme-ov-file#clients).

Once installed, you need to add the following line at the top of your resume
file:

```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://yamlresume.dev/schema.json
```

Then you can enjoy the [auto-completion](#auto-completion), [format
validation](#format-validation), and [property docs](#property-docs) features all
at your fingertips.

## Engineering

Under the hood, YAMLResume's JSON schema is generated with the help of [Zod
v4](https://zod.dev/json-schema), which is a awesome TypeScript-first schema
validation library.

We define the schema in
[schema/resume.ts](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/blob/main/packages/core/src/schema/resume.ts),
and then generate the JSON schema in a [test
case](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/blob/99de/packages/core/src/schema/resume.test.ts#L272-L277).

Isn't this cool?
