YAMLResume is a Node.js tool, under the hood, it transform your resumes from the
YAML format to LaTeX code and then call a LaTeX typesetting engine to compile
the generated LaTeX code to PDF. Besides, to get optimal PDF output, we also
suggest to install some fonts. In a nutshell, you need to install the followings
to get started with YAMLResume:

- Node.js
- [yamlresume package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yamlresume)
- a typesetting engine
- [optional] some fonts

This sounds a bit complicated, but don't worry, we have your back.

## Docker Users

If you are a docker user, you are in luck, we have a [docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/yamlresume/yamlresume) for you. This image has
everything pre-packaged, including:

- [Node.js](/docs/installation#nodejs)
- [yamlresume CLI](/docs/installation#yamlresume)
- [XeTeX](/docs/installation#xetex)
- [some recommended fonts](/docs/installation#font)

You can create a new resume instantly with the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/yamlresume yamlresume/yamlresume new my-resume.yml
```

<Callout title="How does this Docker magic work?">
This command will create a new resume called `my-resume.yml` in your current
directory. Steps:

1. `docker run ... yamlresume/yamlresume` - runs a new container from the
   `yamlresume/yamlresume` image, if this image is not existed in your local
   machine, it will pull it from the [Docker
   Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/yamlresume/yamlresume).
2. `--rm` - automatically removes the container when it exits
3. `-v $(pwd):/home/yamlresume` - mounts the current directory (`$(pwd)`) into
   the container at `/home/yamlresume`, allowing the container to access local
   files
4. `new my-resume.yml` - run yamlresume CLI [new](/docs/cli#new) sub-command to
   create a new resume with the filename `my-resume.yml`

</Callout>

Edit `my-resume.yml` accordingly and then build the resume from yaml to pdf:

```sh
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/yamlresume yamlresume/yamlresume build my-resume.yml
```

Basically, you can call all of the `yamlresume` [CLI sub-commands](/cli) in this
way—just append the sub-command after `yamlresume/yamlresume` and then follow
the corresponding usage guide.

The `-v` flag here is quite important here because it mounts the current
directory (`$(pwd)`) into the container at `/home/yamlresume`, allowing a two
way file sync between the local directory and the container.

<Callout title="Github Mirror">
If you have trouble to pull down `yamlresume/yamlresume` image from [Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/yamlresume/yamlresume), don't worry, we have a
[github mirror](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/pkgs/container/yamlresume)
for you.

You can get the [ghcr
image](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/pkgs/container/yamlresume) by:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/yamlresume/yamlresume
```

</Callout>

### Permission Issues

Sometimes you may run into [permission
issues](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/24) when running the
Docker container because the `yamlresume/yamlresume` image is built with a `USER
yamlresume` instruction, which by default runs with less privilege.

There are two ways to solve this issue:

1. Use your host username/group ID to run the container:

```sh
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/yamlresume -u $(id -u):$(id -g) yamlresume/yamlresume new my-resume.yml
```

This is the recommended way to run the container. As long as your host user has
access to the current directory, you can run the container with your host
username/group ID.

2. Use `-u root` to run the container with root access:

```sh
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/yamlresume -u root yamlresume/yamlresume new my-resume.yml
```

This is the least recommended way to run the container. It is not recommended
because it may cause security issues, so you should only do this if you
are sure about what you are doing.

Last but not least, if you are running the `yamlresume` Docker container in GitHub
Actions, then root access may be required as per [GitHub's
documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/runners/github-hosted-runners#docker-container-filesystem):

> Note: GitHub Actions must be run by the default Docker user (root). Ensure
> your Dockerfile does not set the USER instruction, otherwise you will not be
> able to access GITHUB_WORKSPACE.

Ref: [Understanding the Docker USER Instruction](https://www.docker.com/blog/understanding-the-docker-user-instruction/)

## Non-Docker Users

If you are not a docker user, please follow the appropriate instructions below
to install yamlresume CLI and all the necessary dependencies based on your
operating system. At the time of writing, our guide covers macOS, Windows, and
some Linux distros (Ubuntu and and RHEL based distros).

### Node.js

Node.js 20.x or newer is required.

<Callout title="Why Node.js 20.x or newer?">
  Theoretically `yamlresume` should work with Node.js 18, however it is highly
  recommended to use Node.js 20 or newer because Node.js 18 LTS is scheduled to
  reach End-of-Life on [30 April
  2025](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v18.20.8).
</Callout>

There may be like 100+ methods to install Node.js on different OS, you can check
the official [Node.js Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to get started.

We recommend using a [package
manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/all) to install Node.js.

### YAMLResume CLI

Installing `yamlresume` is a breeze. You can install it using your favourite
Node.js package manager:

<Tabs groupId='package-manager' persist items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
```console tab="npm"
npm install -g yamlresume
```

```console tab="pnpm"
pnpm add -g yamlresume

If you're a macOS user and you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you can also
install [yamlresume via Homebrew](http://formulae.brew.sh/formula/yamlresume):

```sh
brew install yamlresume
```

Verify that `yamlresume` is installed successfully:

```console
$ yamlresume help
Usage: yamlresume [options] [command]

If you just want to give `yamlresume` a try without installing it, you can use
`npx`, `pnpx` or other similar tools:

<Tabs groupId='package-manager' persist items={['npx', 'yarn', 'pnpx', 'bun']}>
```console tab="npx"
npx yamlresume help
```
```console tab="yarn"
yarn dlx yamlresume help
```

```console tab="pnpx"
pnpx yamlresume help
```

```console tab="bun"
bun exec yamlresume help
```

### Typesetting Engine

Under the hood, `yamlresume` does the job of a compiler, parsing a YAML resume
to an
[AST](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/blob/main/packages/core/src/compiler/ast.ts)
and then [transforming the AST to LaTeX
code](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/blob/main/packages/core/src/compiler/codegen/latex.ts).

As a mini-compiler, `yamlresume` relies on a typesetting engine to compile the
generated LaTeX code to PDFs. Therefore you must first install a typesetting
engine first before you can use `yamlresume` to generate resume PDFs.

YAMLResume currently supports two typesetting engines: [XeTeX](#xetex) and
[Tectonic](#tectonic).

<Callout title="Why LaTeX?">
  At the time of writing, [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is still the
  best choice of typesetting engine for producing professional looking PDFs.
  [Typst](https://typst.app/) is a great alternative, but it is still in its
  early stage and its CJK support is not mature and production ready yet.
  Previously I wrote a post [On Typesetting
  Engines](https://blog.ppresume.com/posts/on-typesetting-engines) explaining
  the reasons why I chose LaTeX over other typesetting engines when I founded
  [PPResume](https://ppresume.com).
</Callout>

#### XeTeX

[XeTeX](https://tug.org/xetex/) is a [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX)
typesetting engine using [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) and
supporting modern font technologies such as
[OpenType](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType),
[Graphite](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/graphite) and [Apple Advanced
Typography (AAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Advanced_Typography).

It is a very mature, stable typesetting engine that is widely used by many
academic and scientific people.

<Tabs groupId='os' persist items={['macOS', 'Windows', 'Linux']}>
<Tab value="macOS">
The easiest way is to install the **MacTeX** distribution.

It includes XeTeX along with many other TeX-related programs and packages. You
can download it from the [MacTeX website](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) or
install it via homebrew:

```sh
brew install mactex
```

</Tab>

<Tab value='Windows'>
[MiKTeX distribution](https://miktex.org) is a popular choice for Windows and
includes XeTeX. You can download it from the [MiKTeX
website](https://miktex.org/download).

Alternatively, you can install **TeX Live** for Windows, which also includes
XeTeX. Download it from the [TeX Live
website](https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html).

</Tab>

<Tab value="Linux">
Most Linux distributions offer TeX Live through their package managers. XeTeX is
typically included in the `texlive-xetex` package or a larger `texlive-full`
meta-package.

<Tabs items={['Ubuntu', 'RHEL']}>
<Tab value="Ubuntu">
For Ubuntu, if your network is good and you have around 10GB of disk spaces, you
can install the full texlive distribution:

```sh
sudo apt install texlive-full
```

Otherwise, you can install the minimum required packages:

```sh
sudo apt install texlive-xetex texlive-fonts-extra texlive-lang-all
```

</Tab>

<Tab value="RHEL">
For RHEL-based linux like Fedora, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, you can install the
full TeX Live distribution if you have enough disk space and good network:

```sh
sudo dnf install texlive-scheme-full
```

Otherwise you can install the minimum required packages:

```sh
sudo dnf install \
  texlive-scheme-medium \
  texlive-moderncv \
  texlive-ctex \
  texlive-academicons
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

Alternatively, you can always install TeX Live directly from the [TeX Live
website](https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html) using their
installer, which works across different Linux distributions.

</Tab>

#### Tectonic

[Tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io) is a modernized, complete,
self-contained
[TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX)/[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
engine, powered by [XeTeX](https://tug.org/xetex/) and
[TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/).

A full TeX Live distribution typically takes up several GB of disk space, while
tectonic's initial installation takes up only 10+ MB. It automatically downloads
support files, so you don't have to install a complete LaTeX distribution. When
you start using a new LaTeX package, Tectonic simply downloads the files it
needs and continues processing.

Tectonic provides an official [installation
guide](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/install.html), but this
would just put tectonic in the directory where you ran the installation command,
`yamlresume` needs a global `tectonic` command in your `$PATH`, so you need to
figure that out with some shell hacks on your own.

If you're a macOS user, you're in luck because Homebrew provides prebuilt
package:

```sh
brew install tectonic
```

In to my experience, tectonic still has some minor compatibility issues with
official XeTeX, so if you do not mind the long download tim eof a full TeX Live
distribution, XeTeX is still the recommended choice here.

### Font

#### Linux Libertine

YAMLResume adopts [Linux Libertine](https://www.dafont.com/linux-libertine.font)
as the default font for Latin characters. It is highly recommended to install it
in order to get an optimal PDF output.

<Tabs groupId='font-os' persist items={['macOS', 'Windows', 'Linux']}>

## Troubleshooting

You can [raise an issue](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/new) if
you have trouble to install `yamlresume` or its dependencies.

You can enable verbose logging by passing a `--verbose` flag to `yamlresume` or
its subcommands.

### Getting Tired?

If you are getting tired of the installation process, you can try
[PPResume](https://ppresume.com), which is a hosted, commercial resume builder
solution who open sourced YAMLResume.
