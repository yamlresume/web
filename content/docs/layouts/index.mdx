title: Layouts
---

The core of a resume is the content, but the layout is also important. Lots of
JSON/YAML based resume generators only focus on the content, leaving the
layout untouched, which leaves a big problem for the user.

Unlike other resume generators, YAMLResume provides an opinionated layout
solution out of the box , which allows users to focus on the content of the
resume while generate professional looking resumes with pixel perfect layout and
typesetting.

Starting from v0.8.0, YAMLResume supports multiple layouts and multiple output engines (LaTeX and Markdown) via the `layouts` array.

Here is an example of layout configuration in a `resume.yml` file:

```yml lineNumbers title="resume.yml"
---
content:
  # ...

locale:
  language: en

layouts:
  - engine: latex
    template: moderncv-banking
    page:
      showPageNumbers: true
      margins:
        top: 2.5cm
        left: 1.5cm
        right: 1.5cm
        bottom: 2.5cm
    typography:
      fontSize: 11pt
  - engine: markdown
```

## Engines

YAMLResume currently supports two engines:

- [LaTeX](./layouts/latex): Generates high-quality PDF resumes.
- [Markdown](./layouts/markdown): Generates plain Markdown resumes.

## Locale

The `locale` option allows you to specify the language for your resume. This
will affect the date format, and other locale-specific settings.

```yml lineNumbers
locale:
  language: en
```

Take a look at the [multi languages](/docs/locale) for more
details.
