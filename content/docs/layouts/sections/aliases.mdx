title: Aliases
---

YAMLResume provides default titles for [all resume sections
except](#aliasable-sections) `location` and `profiles`, which are automatically
[translated](/docs/locale) based on the selected [locale
language](/docs/layouts#locale).  However, you may want to customize these titles
to better suit your profile or industry. The `section aliases` feature allows
you to override the default section titles with your own custom names.

For example, you might prefer "Professional Experience" instead of "Work" for
`work` section, or "Technical Proficiencies" instead of "Skills" for `skills`
section.

## How to Use

You can define section aliases within the `layouts.[].sections` configuration of your
`resume.yml` file. Add a `sections` object to your layout, and inside it, an
`aliases` map.

The keys in the `aliases` map are the standard section IDs, and the values are
the custom titles you want to use.

## Example

Here's how you can change the titles for the `work`, `education`, and `skills`
sections:

```yml lineNumbers title="resume.yml"
---
content:
  # ...

layouts:
  - engine: latex
    sections:
      aliases:
        work: Professional Experience
        education: Academic Background
        skills: Technical Skills
```

When you build your resume with this configuration, the generated PDF will use
"Professional Experience", "Academic Background", and "Technical Skills" as the
titles for these sections, overriding the default or locale-specific names.

If an alias is not provided for a section, YAMLResume will fall back to the
default title for the configured locale.

## Aliasable Sections

You can provide aliases for the following sections:

- `basics`
- `education`
- `work`
- `volunteer`
- `awards`
- `certificates`
- `publications`
- `skills`
- `languages`
- `interests`
- `references`
- `projects`

## Rules and Constraints

- An alias must be between 2 and 128 characters in length.
