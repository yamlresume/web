title: Markdown Engine
---

The markdown engine generates a plain Markdown version of your resume. This is
particularly useful when you need to copy-paste your resume content into
applicant tracking systems (ATS) or other forms that don't support PDF upload.

## Configuration

To use the markdown engine, specify `engine: markdown` in your layout
configuration.

```yml
layouts:
  - engine: markdown
```

The markdown output will be generated alongside your PDF (if you have a LaTeX
layout also configured) or as a standalone file.

Unlike the [LaTeX layout](./latex), the Markdown layout is a simple layout which
has no extra configurations except for the [section
aliases](/docs/layouts/sections/aliases) and [section
reorder](/docs/layouts/sections/reorder).

```yml lineNumbers title="resume.yml"
---
content:
  # ...

locale:
  language: en

layouts:
  - engine: markdown
    sections:
      aliases:
        work: Professional Experience
        education: Academic Background
        skills: Technical Skills
      order:
        - basics
        - work
        - education
        - skills
```

The section `aliases` and `order` will be respected in the final markdown
output.
