title: Markdown Engine
---

The Markdown engine generates a plain Markdown version of your resume. This is particularly useful when you need to copy-paste your resume content into applicant tracking systems (ATS) or other forms that don't support PDF upload.

## Configuration

To use the Markdown engine, specify `engine: markdown` in your layout configuration.

```yaml
layouts:
  - engine: markdown
```

The Markdown output will be generated alongside your PDF (if you have a LaTeX layout also configured) or as a standalone file.
