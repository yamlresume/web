title: VS Code
---

## Implementation

VS Code is a dark theme inspired by the "Dark+" color scheme of Visual Studio
Code. It is specifically tailored for developers, software engineers, and
technical professionals who want their resume to reflect their coding
environment.

The template adopts a "Resume as Code" aesthetic, treating different parts of
your profile as code elements:

- **Name**: Decorated as a `class` (e.g., `class JohnDoe {`)
- **Headline**: Rendered as a code comment (e.g., `// Full Stack Engineer`)
- **Sections**: Represented as function calls (e.g., `experience()`)
- **Skills/Languages**: Styled as object property keys (e.g.,
  `JavaScript: Expert`)

Under the hood, the template uses:

- **Typography**: Uses a monospace font stack (`Consolas`, `Monaco`,
  `Courier New`, `monospace`) for an authentic IDE feel
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Uses the official VS Code Dark+ color palette for
  keywords, strings, classes, and functions
- **Layout Indentation**: Features vertical indentation guides (border-left) to
  visually represent the scope of each section

## Configuration

```yml lineNumbers title="resume.yml"
content:
  # ...

layouts:
  - engine: html
    template: vscode # [!code highlight]
    typography:
      fontSize: 16px
```

## Features

- **Developer-Centric**: Perfect for signalling technical proficiency and a
  passion for coding
- **Dark Mode by Default**: High-contrast, easy-on-the-eyes dark theme
- **Code-Like Structure**: Unique visual metaphors that make technical resumes
  stand out
- **Responsive**: Fully adapted for both desktop and mobile viewing with
  consistent code semantics
- **Syntax Styling**: Uses familiar IDE colors to differentiate between roles,
  dates, and descriptions

## Preview

The VS Code template provides a distinctive, modern look that immediately
connects with technical recruiters and hiring managers. It transforms your
career history into a clean, readable, and visually familiar "source file".
