title: HTML Engine
---

The HTML engine generates clean, web-ready HTML versions of your resume. This is
particularly useful for embedding your resume on websites, sharing it online, or
creating a web-based portfolio.

## Configuration

To use the HTML engine, specify `engine: html` in your layout configuration.

```yaml
layouts:
  - engine: html
    template: calm
    # ... other options
```

## Sections

The `sections` option allows you to customize the section titles and their
order. For more information, see the [sections documentation](./sections).

```yml lineNumbers
layouts:
  - engine: html
    sections:
      aliases:
        work: "Professional Experience"
        education: "Education"
        skills: "Skills"
      order:
        - basics
        - work
        - education
```

## Templates

The `template` option allows you to choose from a variety of templates. Each
template has a unique design and layout. You can find a list of available
templates in the [templates documentation](./html/templates).

```yml lineNumbers
layouts:
  - engine: html
    template: calm
```

## Typography

The `typography` option allows you to customize font styles used in your resume.

Currently, only `fontSize` is supported, and the HTML engine supports font sizes
from `14px` to `20px`.

```yaml
layouts:
  - engine: html
    typography:
      fontSize: 16px
```

## Advanced

The `advanced` option allows you to configure advanced settings for the HTML
engine.

```yml lineNumbers
layouts:
  - engine: html
    advanced:
      showIcons: true
```
