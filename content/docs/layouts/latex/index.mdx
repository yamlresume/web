title: LaTeX Engine
---

The LaTeX engine is the core engine of YAMLResume, designed to produce high-quality, professional-looking PDF resumes using LaTeX templates.

## Configuration

To use the LaTeX engine, specify `engine: latex` in your layout configuration.

```yaml
layouts:
  - engine: latex
    template: moderncv-banking
    # ... other options
```

## Page

The `page` option allows you to customize the page settings, such as the paper
size, margins and whether to show page numbers.

```yml lineNumbers
layouts:
  - engine: latex
    page:
      showPageNumbers: true
      # a4 or letter
      paperSize: a4
      margins:
        top: 2.5cm
        left: 1.5cm
        right: 1.5cm
        bottom: 2.5cm
```

## Sections

The `sections` option allows you to customize the section titles and their
order. For more information, see the [sections documentation](./sections).

```yml lineNumbers
layouts:
  - engine: latex
    sections:
      aliases:
        work: "Professional Experience"
        education: "Education"
        skills: "Skills"
      order:
        - basics
        - work
        - education
```

## Templates

The `template` option allows you to choose from a variety of templates. Each
template has a unique design and layout. You can find a list of available
templates in the [templates documentation](./latex/templates).

```yml lineNumbers
layouts:
  - engine: latex
    template: moderncv-banking
```

## Typography

The `typography` option allows you to customize font styles used in your resume.

Currently, only `fontSize` is supported, and the LaTeX engine only supports `10pt`, `11pt`, and `12pt`.

```yaml
layouts:
  - engine: latex
    typography:
      fontSize: 11pt
```

## Advanced

The `advanced` option allows you to configure advanced settings for the LaTeX
engine.

```yml lineNumbers
layouts:
  - engine: latex
    advanced:
      showIcons: true
      fontspec:
        numbers: Lining
```
