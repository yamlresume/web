This chapter delves into the heart of your resume: the content.

Content is the core of your resume. It's what makes your resume stand out from
the rest, with [layouts](/docs/layouts) and design being the icing on the cake.

We'll cover two key aspects of content creation in YAMLResume:

- **Rich Text**: How to use Markdown to add formatting like bold, italics,
  links, and lists to your descriptions.
- **Multi-Language Support**: How to create resumes in different languages,
  taking into account linguistic and cultural nuances.

Explore the guides below to master your resume's content.
