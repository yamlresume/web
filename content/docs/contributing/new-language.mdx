title: New Language

import { Step, Steps } from "fumadocs-ui/components/steps";

YAMLResume is designed to support [multi
languages](/docs/content/multi-languages) bottom up, allowing users to create
resumes in their preferred language.

At the time of writing, YAMLResume supports the following languages:

- [English](/docs/content/multi-languages/english)
- [Chinese](/docs/content/multi-languages/chinese)
- [Norwegian](/docs/content/multi-languages/norwegian)
- [Spanish](/docs/content/multi-languages/spanish)

If your preferred language is not listed, you can contribute by following the
steps below to add support for a new language.

<Steps>

<Step>
## Register Your Language

To add a new `locale.language` option to YAMLResume, first register your
language in
[models/resume.ts](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/blob/main/packages/core/src/models/resume.ts)
by adding a new entry to `LOCALE_LANGUAGE_OPTIONS`.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Add your language to `LOCALE_LANGUAGE_OPTIONS`.
- [ ] Build and test the new CLI](/docs/contributing/cli#yamlresumecli-build)
      with `pnpm cli dev languages list`, making sure your language appears in
      the list.

</Step>

<Step>
## Add Translations

Provide translations for all relevant
[options](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/blob/main/packages/core/src/translations/options.ts),
[punctuations and
terms](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/blob/main/packages/core/src/translations/template.ts)
used in YAMLResume. This ensures users can generate resumes in the new language
with accurate labels, options, terms translations, and section names. Here is
a reference [PR](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/pull/44) for adding
translations for the Norwegian language.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Add translations to [country
      names](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/blob/main/packages/core/src/models/country.ts)
- [ ] Add option translations for `degrees`, `fluency`, `languages`, `sections`,
      and `skills`
- [ ] Add punctuation translations for `comma`, `colon`, and `separator`
- [ ] Add terms translations for `courses`, `keywords`, and `score`

</Step>

<Step>
## Update Babel Configuration

YAMLResume uses LaTeX for PDF generation, and to get best typesetting results,
we need to set proper [babel package
configuration](https://latex3.github.io/babel/). Here is a reference
[commit](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/commit/b72a4441ad2542873f449bc35a265e7208eafbe7)
for norwegian language.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Update `renderBabelConfig()` function in
      [preamble.ts](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/blob/main/packages/core/src/renderer/preamble.ts)
      to include the babel package for your new language.

</Step>

<Step>
## Test with New Language

[Build](/docs/contributing/cli#yamlresumecore-build) `yamlresume/core` and `yamlresume/cli` packages, then:

- [ ] Create a new resume `pnpm cli dev new my-resume.yml`
- [ ] Set `locale.language` to the new language you've just added
- [ ] Test your changes by generating a resume in the new language
      by `pnpm cli dev build my-resume.yml`
- [ ] Make sure both PDF outputs work as expected.

</Step>

<Step>
## Submitting Your PR

Once you have completed the above steps, submit your pull request with a clear
description of the changes and the language you are adding. The maintainers will
review your PR and may request changes or clarifications.
