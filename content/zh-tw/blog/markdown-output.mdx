We are thrilled to announce the release of
[YAMLResume v0.8](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/releases/tag/v0.8.0),
a significant milestone in our journey to make "Resume as Code" the standard for
developers and professionals worldwide.

Since its inception, YAMLResume has focused on one core mission: allowing you to
craft resumes in a clean, version-controlled YAML format and compile them into
beautifully typeset, pixel perfect PDFs. While PDF remains the gold standard for
job applications, we realized that our users often need their resume data in
other formats—for their personal websites, for pasting into applicant tracking
systems (ATS), or even for feeding into Large Language Models (LLMs) for
optimization.

With v0.8, we are introducing a powerful new architecture: [multiple
layouts](/docs/layouts), and with it, first-class support for [Markdown
output](/docs/layouts/markdown).

## YAMLResume with Layouts

In previous versions of YAMLResume, the compilation pipeline was linear and
singular. You provided a YAML file, and the engine spit out a PDF. If you wanted
a different [template](/docs/layouts/latex#templates), you changed the
`layout.template` field. If you wanted a different font size, you tweaked the
[typography](/docs/layouts/latex#typography) settings. But ultimately, the
destination was always a PDF file generated via the [LaTeX](/docs/layouts/latex)
engine.

This worked well, but it was limiting. What if you wanted to generate a PDF for
emailing recruiters, but also a plain text version for a legacy form? What if
you wanted a [Markdown](/docs/layouts/markdown) version to publish on your
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) blog?

In v0.8, we've completely redesigned the [layouts
schema](/docs/compiler/schema/zod#layoutsschema) to support [multiple
layouts](/docs/layouts). Instead of a single set of output settings, you can now
define a list of layouts in your resume's YAML file. Each layout specifies an
`engine` (like `latex` or `markdown`) and its own specific configuration
options.

This means a single [`yamlresume build`](/docs/cli#build) command can now
produce multiple artifacts—a PDF, a Markdown file, and in the future, HTML or
docx files—simultaneously. This adheres to the "Source of Truth" principle: your
`resume.yml` remains the single source of truth, while the outputs are just
derived representations tailored for different delivery channels.

Here is how the new configuration looks in your YAML file:

```yml lineNumbers
# Multiple output layouts configuration
layouts:
  - engine: latex
    page:
      margins:
        top: 2.5cm
        left: 1.5cm
        right: 1.5cm
        bottom: 2.5cm
      showPageNumbers: true
    template: moderncv-banking
    typography:
      fontSize: 11pt
  - engine: markdown
```

As you can see, we have defined two layouts here. The first one uses the
[`latex`](/docs/layouts/latex) engine (our classic PDF generator) with specific template,
page margins and typography settings, etc. The second one uses the new
[`markdown`](/docs/layouts/markdown) engine. The beauty of this approach is that
you can add or remove layouts as needed without touching the actual content of
your resume.

## Markdown as the New Output

Why markdown? Markdown has become the lingua franca of the developer world. It
is lightweight, readable, and universally supported. By adding Markdown as an
output target, YAMLResume bridges the gap between a formal resume document and
the flexible, web-first world.

Let's see it in action. If you have `yamlresume` installed (version 0.8.0 or
higher), you can generate a new resume and build it with just two commands.

### Step 1: Create a New Resume

First, let's generate a boilerplate resume using the [CLI](/docs/cli):

```console
$ yamlresume new my-resume.yml
✔ Created my-resume.yml successfully.
```

This creates a `my-resume.yml` file with the default configuration, which now
includes both [LaTeX](/docs/layouts/latex) and
[Markdown](/docs/layouts/markdown) layouts by default.

Here is the content of a sample resume file `my-resume.yml`—you can ignore the
`content` and take a look for the last line to see the
`markdown` layout configuration:

```yml lineNumbers

### Step 2: Build the Resume

Now, run the build command:

```console lineNumbers
$ yamlresume build my-resume.yml
✔ Generated resume tex file successfully: my-resume.tex
◐ Generating resume pdf file with command: xelatex -halt-on-error my-resume.tex...
✔ Generated resume pdf file successfully: my-resume.pdf
✔ Generated resume markdown file successfully: my-resume.md
```

Notice the last line:
`✔ Generated resume markdown file successfully: my-resume.md`. The CLI has
automatically detected the [`markdown`](/docs/layouts/markdown) layout in your
YAML configuration and generated the corresponding `.md` file alongside the PDF.

### The Resulting Markdown

Let's look at the generated `my-resume.md`. The engine intelligently transforms
your structured YAML data into a clean, well-formatted Markdown document using
standard syntax headers, lists, and links.

## Benefits of Markdown

You might be wondering, "I already have a nice PDF, why do I need a Markdown
version?" The benefits of having a structured, plain-text representation of your
resume are immense, especially in the modern AI-driven world.

### 1. LLM Friendly

This is perhaps the most significant advantage today. We are living in the era
of Large Language Models (LLMs). Tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are
incredibly good at analyzing text, but they might have a hard time with binary
PDF files or complex LaTeX source code.

By generating a clean Markdown version of your resume, you have the perfect
input for an LLM. You can copy-paste your `resume.md` into ChatGPT and ask it
to:

- "Tailor my resume for this Job Description..."
- "Critique my summary section and suggest improvements..."
- "Extract my key skills and format them for a cover letter..."

Because Markdown is semantically structured (headers, lists, bold text), LLMs
can "understand" the hierarchy and content of your resume much better than they
can with raw text or PDF conversions.

### 2. Interoperability and Web Publishing

Markdown is the native content format for the web. If you have a personal
portfolio or blog built with Next.js, Hugo, Jekyll, or Gatsby, you can drop your
`resume.md` directly into your content folder.

With the new Markdown output, you can automate your personal branding workflow:

1. Update your `resume.yml` with your latest job or project.
2. Run `yamlresume build`.
3. The generated `resume.pdf` goes to your download link.
4. The generated `resume.md` updates your "About Me" page on your website.

No more manual copying and pasting or maintaining two separate versions of your
resume.

### 3. Human Readability and Git Diffs

While YAML is readable, Markdown is even more so for long-form text. It serves
as a great intermediate format for reviewing your content without the "noise" of
YAML syntax or LaTeX commands.

Furthermore, because the output is deterministic plain text, you can track
changes easily in Git. If you change a job description, the diff in `resume.md`
will clearly show the text change, which is much friendlier for peer reviews
(e.g., in a GitHub Pull Request) than trying to diff a binary PDF.

### 4. Universal Portability

Markdown can be easily converted into almost any other document format using
tools like [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). Need a `.docx` file for a recruiter
who insists on Word? `pandoc resume.md -f gfm -o resume.docx`. Need an HTML
snippet?  `pandoc resume.md -f gfm -o resume.html`. The Markdown output acts as
a versatile "pivot" format that unlocks compatibility with the entire document
ecosystem.

## Next Thing: HTML Layout

The introduction of the layout system and Markdown engine is just the beginning.
We are actively working on an [HTML layout
engine](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/45).

Imagine running `yamlresume build` and getting a fully responsive,
SEO-optimized, standalone HTML file that looks just as good as your PDF but is
native to the browser. This will allow you to host your resume as a simple
static page on GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify with zero overhead.

The HTML layout will support:

- Responsive design for mobile viewing (no more pinching and zooming PDFs on
  phones).
- SEO metadata automatically generated from your resume content.
- Theming support via CSS variables.
- Interactive elements (e.g., clickable project links, collapsible sections).

We believe that your resume data belongs to you, and you should be able to
render it in whatever format best suits your needs—whether that's a
pixel-perfect PDF for print, a clean Markdown file for AI, or a responsive HTML
page for the web.

## Conclusion

YAMLResume v0.8 is a major step forward in flexibility. By decoupling the
content (YAML) from the presentation (layouts), we are empowering developers to
use their resume data in new and creative ways.

We invite you to upgrade to v0.8, add the `markdown` engine to your layouts, and
experience the freedom of having your resume available in the format you need,
when you need it.

Give it a try:

```console lineNumbers
$ npm install -g yamlresume@latest
$ pnpm install -g yamlresume@latest
$ yarn global add yamlresume@latest
$ bun add -g yamlresume@latest
$ brew install yamlresume
```
