We're excited to announce the release of
[YAMLResume v0.9](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/releases/tag/v0.9.0),
introducing first-class support for [HTML output](/docs/layouts/html). Following
our [v0.8 release](/blog/markdown-output) that brought [Markdown
output](/docs/layouts/markdown), we're now taking another major step forward in
making your resume data truly versatile and web-native.

With v0.9, you can now compile your YAML resume directly into a standalone,
responsive HTML file—perfect for hosting on your personal website, GitHub Pages,
or any static hosting platform. No more converting PDFs or manually maintaining
separate web versions of your resume.

For now we only provide one template for HTML layout—the
[calm](/docs/layouts/html/templates/calm) template, which is inspired by the
moderncv LaTeX template. It features a minimalist design with clear section
separation and an elegant layout optimized for web viewing. Here is the preview:

A quick demo for how to use YAMLResume v0.9 to generate HTML resume:

## Why HTML?

When we introduced the [multiple layouts architecture](/docs/layouts) in v0.8,
we envisioned a world where your single `resume.yml` could be rendered into any
format you need. We started with [LaTeX/PDF](/docs/layouts/latex) for
professional applications and [Markdown](/docs/layouts/markdown) for
interoperability and LLM workflows. Now, HTML completes the trinity of essential
resume formats.

HTML offers unique advantages:

**Web-Native**: HTML is the language of the web. Your resume becomes a first-class
citizen on the internet, not just a document you have to embed or convert.

**Responsive Design**: Unlike PDFs that require pinching and zooming on mobile
devices, HTML resumes adapt seamlessly to any screen size—from desktop monitors
to smartphones.

**SEO-Friendly**: Search engines can index your HTML resume, making your skills
and experience discoverable. This is impossible with PDF-only resumes.

**Interactive**: HTML enables clickable links, smooth scrolling, and other
interactive elements that enhance the user experience beyond static documents.

**Zero Dependencies**: The HTML output is a self-contained file with inline CSS.
Drop it anywhere—S3, Netlify, GitHub Pages—and it just works.

## Getting Started

If you have `yamlresume` installed (version 0.9.0 or higher), adding HTML output
to your resume is as simple as updating your layouts configuration.

### Step 1: Update Your Resume Configuration

Add the HTML layout to your `resume.yml`:

```yml lineNumbers
layouts:
  - engine: latex
    template: moderncv-banking
    typography:
      fontSize: 11pt
  - engine: markdown
  - engine: html
    template: calm
    typography:
      fontSize: 16px
```

The HTML engine supports customizable [typography](/docs/layouts/html#typography)
with font sizes ranging from 14px to 20px. The default `calm` template is
inspired by the popular LaTeX `moderncv` package, providing a clean, professional
look.

### Step 2: Build Your Resume

Run the build command:

```console
$ yamlresume build my-resume.yml
✔ Generated resume tex file successfully: my-resume.tex
◐ Generating resume pdf file with command: xelatex -halt-on-error my-resume.tex...
✔ Generated resume pdf file successfully: my-resume.pdf
✔ Generated resume markdown file successfully: my-resume.md
✔ Generated resume html file successfully: my-resume.html
```

That's it! You now have three output files from a single source of truth.

## The Calm Template

The initial release includes the `calm` template, a carefully designed layout
that balances professionalism with readability. The template features:

- **Clean Typography**: Optimized font sizes and line heights for both screen and
  print.
- **Responsive Layout**: Automatically adapts from wide desktop screens to narrow
  mobile displays.
- **Semantic HTML**: Uses proper HTML5 semantic elements for better accessibility
  and SEO.
- **Print-Friendly**: While designed for the web, the template includes print
  styles so it looks great when saved as PDF from the browser.

The design philosophy of the `calm` template mirrors the aesthetic of the LaTeX
`moderncv` templates—modern, uncluttered, and focused on content.

## HTML Layout Features

### Typography Customization

The HTML engine currently supports customization of font size:

```yml lineNumbers
layouts:
  - engine: html
    template: calm
    typography:
      fontSize: 16px  # Range: 14px to 20px
```

Font size adjustments affect the entire document proportionally, maintaining
visual hierarchy and readability. We chose a range of 14px to 20px based on web
typography best practices—ensuring legibility without sacrificing design.

### Self-Contained Output

The generated HTML file is completely self-contained. All CSS styles are inlined,
meaning you don't need to worry about external stylesheets, CDN links, or missing
dependencies. Upload the single `.html` file anywhere and it will render
perfectly.

### Standards-Compliant

The HTML output follows modern web standards:

- Valid HTML5 markup
- CSS for styling and responsive design
- UTF-8 encoding for international character support
- Semantic elements (`<header>`, `<section>`) for better structure

## Use Cases

### Personal Website

Host your resume as a `/resume` or `/cv` page on your personal domain. Since the
HTML file is static, it loads instantly and requires no backend infrastructure.

```console
$ yamlresume build resume.yml
$ cp resume.html ~/my-website/public/cv/index.html
$ git add . && git commit -m "Update CV"
$ git push
```

Your updated resume is now live.

### GitHub Pages

Combine YAMLResume with GitHub Actions to automatically publish your resume to
GitHub Pages whenever you update your `resume.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy Resume
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install YAMLResume
        run: npm install -g yamlresume
      - name: Build Resume
        run: yamlresume build --no-pdf -o public resume.yml
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./public
```

### Responsive Portfolio

Embed your resume directly into your portfolio. Since the HTML is
self-contained, you can even iframe it or extract the styles for deeper
integration.

### Quick Sharing

Email the HTML file or share it via Dropbox/Google Drive. Recipients can open it
in any browser without needing PDF readers or special software.

## Technical Architecture

The [HTML
renderer](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/blob/main/packages/core/src/renderer/html/renderer.ts)
is built with the same rigorous engineering standards as our LaTeX/Markdown
engine. Under the hood:

1. **Type-Safe Rendering**: The renderer is written in TypeScript with full type
   safety through [Zod schemas](/docs/compiler/schema/zod).

2. **Template System**: Templates are modular and extensible. While we ship with
   `calm` initially, the architecture supports multiple templates. Future
   templates can be added easily.

3. **CSS Methodology**: We use a combination of CSS Reset (based on modern-normalize)
   and scoped template styles to ensure consistent rendering across browsers.

4. **Escape Handling**: All content is [properly
   HTML-escaped](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/blob/v0.9.1/packages/core/src/utils/string.ts#L34-L44)
   to prevent injection vulnerabilities and ensure special characters render
   correctly.

5. **Comprehensive Testing**: The HTML renderer includes over 1,000 lines of
   [test
   cases](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/blob/v0.9.1/packages/core/src/renderer/html/renderer.test.ts)
   which achieves 100% test coverage and guarantees the renderer works as
   expected.

## Comparison: LaTeX vs Markdown vs HTML

Let's see how the three engines compare:

| Feature           | LaTeX (PDF)      | Markdown           | HTML               |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| **Use Case**      | Job applications | AI/LLMs, content   | Web hosting        |
| **Formatting**    | Pixel-perfect    | Minimal            | Responsive         |
| **Portability**   | Universal        | Universal          | Web-native         |
| **Customization** | Extensive        | Limited            | Growing            |
| **File Size**     | ~50-200 KB       | ~5-20 KB           | ~20-50 KB          |
| **Dependencies**  | LaTeX toolchain  | None               | None               |
| **Interactive**   | No               | No                 | Yes                |
| **SEO**           | No               | When published     | Yes                |
| **Responsive**    | No               | Depends on renderer| Yes                |

Each engine excels in its domain. The beauty of YAMLResume's architecture is that
you don't have to choose—generate all three from the same source file and use
each where it fits best.

## What's Next?

The v0.9 HTML engine has set a solid foundation, but we have ambitious plans for
future enhancements:

### More Templates

We'll be adding additional templates with different design aesthetics—minimalist,
creative, corporate, etc. Want to contribute a template? Check out our
[contribution guide](/docs/contributing).

### Extended Customization

Future releases will expand typography options to include font families, color
schemes, and spacing controls, giving you more control over the visual
presentation.

### Dark Mode

Built-in dark mode support using CSS variables and `prefers-color-scheme` media
queries.

### Accessibility Enhancements

While the current implementation uses semantic HTML, we plan to add comprehensive
ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support to make resumes accessible to all
users.

## Conclusion

YAMLResume v0.9 brings HTML layout support, completing the core output format
trilogy. Now, from a single `resume.yml` file, you can generate:

- A professional PDF via LaTeX for job applications
- A clean Markdown file for LLMs and content workflows
- A responsive HTML page for web hosting and online portfolios

This release reinforces our commitment to the "Resume as Code" philosophy: write
once, render anywhere. Your resume data remains the single source of truth, and
the outputs are just different views optimized for different contexts.

We invite you to upgrade to v0.9 and experience the flexibility of web-native
resumes:

```console
$ npm install -g yamlresume@latest
$ pnpm install -g yamlresume@latest
$ yarn global add yamlresume@latest
$ bun add -g yamlresume@latest
$ brew install yamlresume
```
