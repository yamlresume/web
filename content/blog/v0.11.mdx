We're excited to announce [YAMLResume
v0.11](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/releases/tag/v0.11.1). This
release brings significant developer experience improvements with a new
embeddable Playground component, environment diagnostics via the `doctor`
command, expanded language support, and typography customization.

## New Package: @yamlresume/playground

We've extracted and published our web playground as a standalone React
component: [`@yamlresume/playground`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yamlresume/playground).
This package powers the official [playground](/playground) and can now be
integrated into your own applications.

![YAMLResume Playground](/static/images/blog/yamlresume-playground.webp)

```bash
npm install @yamlresume/playground @yamlresume/core
```

The Playground component provides:

- **Live YAML Editor**: [Monaco-based
  editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) with YAML syntax
  highlighting
- **Real-time Preview**: Instant preview for HTML, Markdown and LaTeX layouts
- **Responsive Design**: Split-pane layout on desktop, tabbed interface on mobile
- **Export Options**: Download, copy, or print your resume

Basic usage is straightforward:

```tsx
import { useState } from "react"
import { Playground } from "@yamlresume/playground"

function App() {
  const [yaml, setYaml] = useState("layouts: []");

  return (
    <Playground yaml={yaml} onChange={(newYaml) => setYaml(newYaml)} />
  )
}
```

The package also exports hooks like `useResumeState` and `useResumeRenderer` for
building custom editor experiences. See the [package
README](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/tree/main/packages/playground)
for the full API reference.

## New Command: yamlresume doctor

Setting up a LaTeX environment can be tricky. The new `doctor` command helps
diagnose your setup by checking for required dependencies:

```console
$ yamlresume doctor

  System:
    OS: macOS 14.6.1
    CPU: (10) arm64 Apple M1 Max
  Binaries:
    Node: 25.6.0 - /opt/homebrew/bin/node
    Yarn: 1.22.22 - /Users/hanyu/Library/pnpm/yarn
    npm: 11.8.0 - /opt/homebrew/bin/npm
    pnpm: 10.6.3 - /opt/homebrew/bin/pnpm

  Linux Libertine O: Not Installed
  Linux Libertine: Installed
  Noto Serif CJK SC: Installed
  Noto Sans CJK SC: Installed
```

The doctor command checks:

- **System information**: OS, CPU architecture
- **Binaries**: Node.js, npm, pnpm, Yarn, Bun
- **LaTeX engines**: XeTeX and Tectonic availability
- **Fonts**: Required fonts for optimal resume rendering (Linux Libertine for
  Latin text, Noto CJK for Chinese/Japanese/Korean)

This is particularly helpful when setting up YAMLResume on a new machine or
troubleshooting resume build issues.

## Japanese and German Language Support

YAMLResume continues to expand its internationalization. We now support two more
languages:

- **Japanese (ja)**: Full support for Japanese section headers, date formats,
  and country names
- **German (de)**: Thanks to [Daniel Bälz](https://github.com/dbaelz) for
  contributing German translations

This brings our supported language count to eight:

- [English (en)](/docs/locale/english)
- [Chinese (zh)](/docs/locale/chinese)
- [Spanish (es)](/docs/locale/spanish)
- [French (fr)](/docs/locale/french)
- [Norwegian (no)](/docs/locale/norwegian)
- [Dutch (nl)](/docs/locale/dutch)
- [Japanese (ja)](/docs/locale/japanese)
- [German (de)](/docs/locale/german)

To generate your resume in Japanese or German:

```yml lineNumbers
locale:
  language: ja  # or 'de' for German
```

## Font Family Customization

You can now customize the font family for both HTML and LaTeX engines. This
gives you precise control over typography to match your personal brand or
regional preferences.

### HTML Engine

```yml lineNumbers
layouts:
  - engine: html
    typography:
      fontFamily: '"Inter", "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif'
```

Each HTML template adopts a list of fonts as the default, and when you specify
the `fontFamily` in your layout configuration, it will be prepended to the
default list.

### LaTeX Engine

```yml lineNumbers
layouts:
  - engine: latex
    typography:
      fontFamily: "EB Garamond"
```

`fontFamily` for LaTeX engine also supports CSS font family syntax, i.e, the
comma separated list of fonts. YAMLResume's LaTeX engine will use
`\IfFontExistsTF` macro to check the existence of each font and it will only
pick the first one which is accessible to XeTeX/Tectonic in the list.

## Other Improvements

- **Türkiye naming**: Updated country name from "Turkey" to "Türkiye" to reflect
  the official name change ([#152](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/152))
- **Improved test coverage**: Added cross-platform testing on Node.js 22 and 24
  across macOS, Linux, and Windows
