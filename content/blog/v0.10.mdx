We are thrilled to announce the release of
[YAMLResume v0.10](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/releases/tag/v0.10.0).
This release focuses on expanding our layout ecosystem with a developer-favorite
theme, broadening our international support, and adding fine-grained control
over document formatting.

## New HTML Template: VS Code

For developers, your code editor is your home. Now your resume can feel just as
familiar. We've introduced a new [VS Code
template](/docs/layouts/html/templates/vscode) for the HTML engine, featuring a
dark theme inspired by the "Dark+" color scheme of Visual Studio Code.

It features syntax-highlighting aesthetics—treating your name like a class, your
skills like objects, and your experience like functions. To use it, simply
update your layout configuration:

```yml lineNumbers
layouts:
  - engine: html
    template: vscode  #[!code highlight]
```

This template is perfect for software engineers, devops professionals, and
anyone who wants to signal their technical roots immediately.

## Dutch Language Support

YAMLResume continues to grow globally. Thanks to the contribution from
[MattiaPun](https://github.com/MattiaPun), we now support [Dutch
(nl)](/docs/locale/dutch)!

This brings our supported languages count to six:

- [English (en)](/docs/locale/english)
- [Chinese (zh)](/docs/locale/chinese)
- [Spanish (es)](/docs/locale/spanish)
- [French (fr)](/docs/locale/french)
- [Norwegian (no)](/docs/locale/norwegian)
- [Dutch (nl)](/docs/locale/dutch)

To generate your resume in Dutch, set the locale in your `resume.yml`:

```yml lineNumbers
locale:
  language: nl
```

This will automatically translate section headers (e.g., "Werkervaring",
"Opleidingen"), date formats, and country names.

## LaTeX Paper Size Support

We've added explicit control over paper sizes for the LaTeX/PDF engine. While A4
is the standard in many parts of the world, US Letter is essential for North
America.

You can now specify your preferred paper size directly in the configuration:

```yml lineNumbers
layouts:
  - engine: latex
    page:
      # Options: 'a4' (default) or 'letter'
      paperSize: letter   #[!code highlight]
```

This ensures your PDF resume prints perfectly regardless of your region. Special
thanks to [djryanj](https://github.com/djryanj) for driving this feature!

## Toggle Icons

Sometimes less is more. While icons add visual flair, certain formal or
ATS-focused contexts might require a stricter text-only presentation.

We've introduced a `showIcons` option under the `advanced` settings for both HTML
and LaTeX engines. This gives you the flexibility to toggle icons for contact
details and social profiles on or off.

```yml lineNumbers
layouts:
  - engine: html
    advanced:
      showIcons: false  #[!code highlight]
  - engine: latex
    advanced:
      showIcons: false  #[!code highlight]
```

## Conclusion

YAMLResume v0.10 is about giving you more choices—from how your resume looks to
how it fits your local standards.

Upgrade today to explore the new features:

```console
$ npm install -g yamlresume@latest
# or

As always, we welcome your feedback and contributions on
[GitHub](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume). Happy building!
