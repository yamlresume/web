YAMLResume has just been
[accepted](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/246949) by
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (the most popular package manager on macOS). That
means macOS users can now install and keep YAMLResume up to date with a single,
trustworthy command—no manual [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) global installs, no
path juggling. This post shows a more detailed step-by-step yamlresume setup with
Homebrew and a typesetting engine for best PDF output.

## Why This Matters

Previously, the typical path of getting YAMLResume CLI for macOS users was:

1. [install Node.js](/docs/installation#nodejs),
2. [install `yamlresume` CLI](/docs/installation#yamlresume-cli) by Node.js
   package managers (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun)
3. [install a typesetting engine](/docs/installation#typesetting-engine) in
   order to generate PDF

A [Homebrew formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/yamlresume) can merge step
1 and 2 into one, since Homebrew can manage the Node.js dependency for you.
This reduces environment configuration issues and simplifies upgrades (`brew
upgrade yamlresume`).

## Quick Install

```sh
brew install yamlresume
```

Homebrew will install Node.js as a dependency if you don't have it yet.

![brew install yamlresume](/static/images/blog/yamlresume-homebrew/brew-install-yamlresume.webp)

Then verify:

```console
$ yamlresume help
Usage: yamlresume [options] [command]

YAMLResume — Resume as Code in YAML

 __   __ _    __  __ _     ____
 \ \ / // \  |  \/  | |   |  _ \ ___  ___ _   _ ___  ___   ___
  \ V // _ \ | |\/| | |   | |_) / _ \/ __| | | / _ \/ _ \ / _ \
   | |/ ___ \| |  | | |___|  _ <  __/\__ \ |_| | | | | | |  __/
   |_/_/   \_\_|  |_|_____|_| \_\___||___/\____|_| |_| |_|\___|


Options:
  -V, --version                  output the version number
  -v, --verbose                  verbose output
  -h, --help                     display help for command

Commands:
  new [filename]                 create a new resume
  build [options] <resume-path>  build a resume to LaTeX and PDF
  dev [options] <resume-path>    build a resume on file changes (watch mode)
  languages                      i18n and l10n support
  templates                      manage resume templates
  validate <resume-path>         validate a resume against the YAMLResume schema
  help [command]                 display help for command
```

If you see the help output, the CLI binary is available in your `PATH`.

YAMLResume depends on a typesetting engine to generate PDF, you can either
install [MacTeX](/docs/installation#xetex) or
[Tectonic](/docs/installation#tectonic) via Homebrew.

### Option A: Full TeX Live (XeTeX)

Install via MacTeX cask (includes XeTeX):

```sh
# install the full mactex
brew install mactex
# or if you want to save some disk space
brew install mactex-no-gui
```

After installation, ensure the TeX binaries are on `PATH` (Homebrew usually
symlinks them under `/Library/TeX/texbin`). Test:

```console
$ xelatex --version
XeTeX 3.141592653-2.6-0.999994 (TeX Live 2022)

```

### Option B: Tectonic (Lightweight)

```console
$ brew install tectonic
$ tectonic --version
```

Which one should you pick?

| Engine   | Pros                                                 | Cons                                   |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| XeTeX    | maximal compatibility; mature ecosystem              | large download (4-6 GBs)               |
| Tectonic | tiny initial footprint; auto-fetches needed packages | occasional compatibility gaps vs XeTeX |

If you run into unexplained LaTeX package issues or advanced font handling edge
cases, fall back to XeTeX.

## Create and Build a Resume

As usual, you can create a starter YAML resume by:

```console
$ yamlresume new my-resume.yml
✔ Created my-resume.yml successfully.
```

Inspect and edit `my-resume.yml` in your editor, then build to PDF:

```console
$ yamlresume build my-resume.yml
◐ Generating resume PDF with command: xelatex -halt-on-error my-resume.tex...
✔ Generated resume PDF successfully.
```

Under the hood YAMLResume will:

1. transforms `my-resume.yml` into LaTeX (`my-resume.tex`).
2. invokes your typesetting engine (`xelatex` or `tectonic`).
3. produces `my-resume.pdf`.

## Upgrading

Stay current (new templates, fixes, i18n improvements):

```console
$ brew update
$ brew upgrade yamlresume
```

## Uninstalling

```console
$ brew uninstall yamlresume
```

Remove optional dependencies only if you no longer need them (fonts, TeX engine,
etc.).

## Troubleshooting

Verbose mode helps diagnose resume build issues:

```console
$ yamlresume build --verbose my-resume.yml
```

Common fixes:

- missing typesetting engine: install MacTeX or use Tectonic.
- permission denied writing files: ensure you are in a writable directory (avoid
  system paths).
- engine mismatch/weird LaTeX errors on Tectonic: fall back to XeTeX (`brew
install mactex`).

## Final Notes

Being included in Homebrew lowers the barrier for new users and signals project
maturity. If you run into any edge cases, open an
[issue](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/) or
[discussion](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/discussions)—we iterate
quickly. Happy hacking and may your resumes be always pixel perfect!

include YAMLResume in Homebrew.
