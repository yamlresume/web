When you build a PDF resume with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), small
visual details carry a lot of weight. The
[`moderncv`](https://ctan.org/pkg/moderncv) class adds icons next to contact
fields (phone, email, homepage, and so on), which is great for a polished look,
but not everyone wants icons in their header. Some people prefer a cleaner, more
minimal style, or need to match a corporate template that forbids pictograms.
This post explains what `moderncv` is, which icon library it relies on, how to
hide its icons, and how the LaTeX `\renewcommand` macro makes it all possible.

## 1. What is moderncv?

[`moderncv`](https://ctan.org/pkg/moderncv) is a LaTeX document class designed
specifically for CVs and resumes. It provides a consistent, professional layout
and a set of high-level macros to format common resume elements: name, title,
contact details, section headings, and entries for work and education. Compared
to a raw LaTeX document, `moderncv` gives you a purpose-built layout system with
a few style variants (such as `banking`, `classic`, or `casual`, etc.)

A typical `moderncv` header might look like this:

```latex
\name{}{Andy Dufresne}
\title{Software Engineer}
\phone[mobile]{+1 555 123 456}
\email{jane@example.com}
\homepage{https://example.com}
```

The class takes these commands and renders them in a neat header. By default,
`moderncv` also shows icons alongside each item, which can make contact info
easier to scan.

## 2. What is the icons lib used by moderncv?

`moderncv` ships with icon support through the
[`fontawesome5`](https://ctan.org/pkg/fontawesome5) package.
[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is a popular icon set, and
`fontawesome5` exposes it to LaTeX with commands like `\faEnvelope`,
`\faMobileAlt`, and `\faGlobe`. In `moderncv`, those icons are wired into
“symbol” macros such as `\emailsymbol` and `\homepagesymbol`. When you call
`\email{...}` or `\homepage{...}`, the class prepends the corresponding symbol
macro, which in turn uses a Font Awesome glyph.

Because the icons are routed through these symbol macros, you can replace or
remove them without changing the actual contact content. This design is
important: the content and the decoration are separate, so you can opt into a
cleaner style with a few overrides.

## 3. How to hide icons in moderncv

The cleanest way to remove icons is to redefine the symbol macros to empty
strings. In LaTeX, `\renewcommand` lets you replace an existing macro with new
behavior. If you set each `moderncv` symbol macro to nothing, the labels remain,
but the icons disappear.

Here is the minimal snippet you can place in the preamble, after loading
`moderncv`:

```latex
% disable icons
\renewcommand*{\addresssymbol}{}
\renewcommand*{\mobilephonesymbol}{}
\renewcommand*{\fixedphonesymbol}{}
\renewcommand*{\faxphonesymbol}{}
\renewcommand*{\emailsymbol}{}
\renewcommand*{\homepagesymbol}{}
```

This mirrors the approach used in [YAMLResume](https://yamlresume.dev/)’s
`moderncv` renderer. In YAMLResume [v0.10](/blog/v0.10), the LaTeX preamble
[optionally
inserts](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/commit/b53f73d9b4b04bf04b90236ef01da56062f8ca1f)
exactly these `\renewcommand*` lines when a layout option under `advanced`
config named `showIcons` is set to `false`. That means the PDF output can toggle
icons without touching resume content.

Here the moderncv resume without icons:

If you are using YAMLResume, you can control this behavior via layout settings
and let the renderer inject those overrides automatically. If you are writing
raw LaTeX, you can copy the snippet into your preamble. Either way, the end
result is the same: your header keeps the text but loses the pictograms.

### Why this works

`moderncv` defines a set of macros for each icon. For example, `\emailsymbol` is
used to display the email icon. When you redefine that macro to `{}`, LaTeX
still expands it, but there’s nothing to print. You are not removing the email
itself; you are only overriding the decoration that precedes it.

### Extra tip: hiding social icons

If you are manually adding icons in custom fields (for example, using
`\faGithub` or `\faTwitter` in a custom line), you can also remove them by
simply not calling those commands. In YAMLResume’s renderer, this is handled by
checking a `showIcons` flag before inserting the Font Awesome glyphs for social
profiles. The pattern is the same: keep the `\href` content, but omit the icon
prefix.

## 4. What is the \renewcommand macro?

LaTeX uses macros to define how commands behave. The `\newcommand` macro creates
a new command, while `\renewcommand` redefines an existing one. Think of it as
“override this command with a new implementation.”

The syntax is:

```latex
\renewcommand{\commandname}{replacement}
```

The starred version `\renewcommand*` behaves similarly, but it tells LaTeX not
to allow a paragraph break in the replacement text. For short symbol macros like
`\emailsymbol`, the star makes little practical difference, but it is common in
class files and templates.

In `moderncv`, the icon macros are already defined, so you must use
`\renewcommand` rather than `\newcommand`. If you try to redefine an existing
macro with `\newcommand`, LaTeX will throw an error. That is why the patch uses:

```latex
\renewcommand*{\emailsymbol}{}
```

This line says: “Replace the existing definition of `\emailsymbol` with an empty
string.” The rest of the class keeps working, because `\email{...}` still
expands correctly; it just doesn’t prepend the icon anymore.

## Putting it all together

To summarize:

- `moderncv` is a LaTeX class for CVs and resumes with structured macros and
  nice defaults.
- It uses the `fontawesome5` package for icons, exposed through symbol macros
  like `\emailsymbol` and `\homepagesymbol`.
- You can hide icons by redefining those symbol macros to empty strings with
  `\renewcommand*`.
- `\renewcommand` is the LaTeX mechanism for overriding existing macros safely.

If you want a minimal, text-only header, the override approach is the most
robust. It’s also future-proof: if you later switch to a new `moderncv` style or
add new contact fields, you can keep the same pattern by redefining the
corresponding symbol macros. And if you are using a renderer like YAMLResume, a
simple flag can toggle the entire block for you. And by the way, this
`advanced.showIcons` works for both [HTML](/docs/layouts/html) and
[LaTeX](/docs/layouts/latex) engine.
