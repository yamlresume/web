YAMLResume just crossed a huge milestone: [1000 GitHub
stars](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/stargazers)—roughly half a year
after [open sourcing the project](/blog/introducing-yamlresume). Thank you for
every star, issue, discussion, contribution, and word-of-mouth share. It's a
small badge, but one that reflects real momentum for "resume as code", great
typesetting, and a developer-first workflow.

In June we celebrated [500 stars](/blog/500-stars), today we're back with 1000.
In between, YAMLResume matured significantly—especially across three releases
that many of you followed and adopted quickly:
[v0.5](/blog/yamlresume-compiler), [v0.6](/blog/section-customization), and
[v0.7](/blog/dev-mode). This post recaps the most important things we shipped,
then lays out a pragmatic roadmap for the next leg of the journey.

## Recap

### v0.5: The Resume Compiler you can trust

[v0.5](/blog/yamlresume-compiler) reframed YAMLResume not just as a formatter,
but as a compiler. That single conceptual shift—treating a resume YAML like
source code—unlocked correctness, consistency, and a brutally simple CLI
workflow.

Key ideas we shipped in v0.5:

- [Compiler architecture](/docs/compiler/architecture) and standard [data
model](/docs/compiler/schema): We formalized the resume structure so any
downstream renderer or template gets clean, predictable data. This reduced
footguns and improved template portability.
- Strong validation at two levels: [JSON Schema for editor
integration](/docs/compiler/schema/json) (auto-completion, hover docs, early
format checks) and [Zod for runtime safety and detailed
diagnostics](/docs/compiler/schema/zod). Editors feel smart; builds feel safe.
- New commands that shorten loops: [`yamlresume validate`](/docs/cli#validate)
for quick checks, and improved `build` that always validates first. With the
`--no-validate` opt-out, you stay in motion during big edits.
- [Clang-style error output](https://asciinema.org/a/728098): Clear errors tied
to filenames and lines save minutes for every iteration.

v0.5 made YAMLResume a tool you can trust—even under deadlines. If
you haven't yet, skim the examples and videos in the v0.5 blog; they show the
validator, schema hints, and diagnostics in action.

### v0.6: Section customization that matches how you tell your story

[v0.6](/blog/section-customization) focused on something deceptively simple but
incredibly powerful: expressing your narrative in your own voice and order,
without forking templates or hacking LaTeX.

What shipped:

- [Section aliases](/docs/layouts/sections/aliases): Rename canonical sections
(e.g., turn `work` into "Professional Experience," `education` into "Academic
Background") using `layout.sections.aliases`. This is especially useful for
tone, region/culture, or role targeting.
- [Section reordering](/docs/layouts/sections/reorder): Bring the most relevant
sections to the top with `layout.sections.order`. Put `skills` ahead of `work`,
or surface `projects` first for portfolio-heavy roles.
- Practical resilience: Improvements like tolerating invalid dates (falling back
to strings)

Why it matters:

- Hiring contexts differ. A PhD applying to a postdoc wants `education` first; a
staff engineer wants `work` first. v0.6 puts that choice one YAML edit away.
- Language and tone shape perception. Aliasing lets you match industry norms
("Experience," "Selected Publications," "Open Source") without template surgery.

In short: v0.6 made YAMLResume adaptable to your narrative, not the other way around.

### v0.7: Dev mode, because resumes deserve modern DX too

[v0.7](/blog/dev-mode) shipped a watch-mode development flow that feels like hot
reloading for resumes. Save your YAML, and the PDF rebuilds automatically. Small
changes stop costing big context switches.

What shipped:

- [`yamlresume dev`](/docs/cli#dev): A persistent process that watches your
resume file and rebuilds on save. Pair it with a side-by-side PDF viewer for
instant feedback.
- Robust watch internals: We adopted
[chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) and added [coalescing
logic](https://github.com/yamlresume/coalescifn) so we never storm builds on
quick successive saves. Only one build at a time; the latest state always wins.
- Practical flags in dev: `--no-pdf` when you only need `.tex` for debugging,
`--no-validate` during large refactors when speed matters most.

Why it matters:

- You iterate faster and write better.
- The tool takes the tedium, you keep the flow. That's the whole point of DX.

If you're used to `npm run dev`, you'll feel right at home.

### YAMLResume with Homebrew

Last but not least, YAMLResume is now available on [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```sh
brew install yamlresume
```

We've published a new blog post to explain how to use it in detail: [YAMLResume
Lands in Homebrew](/blog/yamlresume-homebrew).

![brew install yamlresume](/static/images/blog/yamlresume-homebrew/brew-install-yamlresume.webp)

## Looking ahead

YAMLResume has come a long way from the tiny core engine of
[PPResume](https://ppresume.com) to a powerful resume compiler today. But we
still have lots of work to do to further enhance YAMLResume's capabilities and
make it the ideal tool for resume crafting.

### Multiple layouts

Right now YAMLResume only supports LaTeX output. We're going to extend the
compiler-to-renderer pipeline to support multiple layout engines and output
formats, starting with Markdown, then HTML.

Here are the features we're going to ship:

- [Markdown output](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/110): A
clean, structured Markdown artifact that mirrors your resume's sections and
content. Useful for READMEs, job portals that accept Markdown, or handoffs to
other resume builders that accept markdown.
- [HTML output](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues/45): HTML is the
most popular output format for web resumes. The day YAMLResume supports HTML
output, you can host your resume anywhere, share it with anyone and open it on
any device.

One data model, many outputs. The compiler's validation remains the spine;
renderers become plugins. You pick the output(s) per audience: PDF for formal
submissions, HTML for web presence, Markdown for dev-facing channels.

### GitHub Actions

Some people adopted YAMLResume to [build and host their resumes on
GitHub](https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/discussions/50), each of them
has their own workflow to generate PDF though.

We're going to ship an official GitHub YAMLResume action so that people can
validate, build, host and publish their resume, without having to write their
own workflow.

With a dedicated GitHub Action, updates become push-and-done.

### More languages

YAMLResume v0.7 already supports
[English](/docs/content/multi-languages/english),
[Chinese](/docs/content/multi-languages/chinese),
[Norwegian](/docs/content/multi-languages/norwegian) and
[Spanish](/docs/content/multi-languages/spanish), we are going to expand the
list to support more languages, making YAMLResume even more accessible to more
people around the world.

French, German, Japanese will be the first batch of languages we're going to
support in the next few months.

## Regards

1000 stars is not an end but another start. It came from your early adoption,
bug reports, language contributions, and thoughtful requests that shaped the
roadmap. Thank you for your support and contributions.

Here's how to keep momentum going:

- Try the latest CLI: `npm install -g yamlresume@latest` or `brew install
yamlresume` on macOS.
- Use dev mode for your next edit loop: `yamlresume dev my-resume.yml`.
- File issues and ideas: https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/issues
- Join discussions: https://github.com/yamlresume/yamlresume/discussions

We'll keep shipping pragmatic features that make resume writing calmer, faster,
and better-looking—while staying true to a single, validated source of truth.
Onward to the next milestone.
