        "question": "What is YAMLResume?",
        "answer1": "YAMLResume is a tool that allows you to manage your resume as code using YAML. It provides a structured way to define your work experience, skills, education, and other resume sections in a simple & version-controllable plain text document. YAMLResume then converts this YAML data into beautifully typeset PDF documents which is ready for job and scholarship applications.",
        "answer2": "YAMLResume started out as the core typesetting engine for PPResume, a LaTeX based, pixel perfect resume builder. After careful consideration, we decided to open source it so that people can always have the right to say no to vendor lock-in."
      },
      "whyYaml": {
        "question": "Why YAML over JSON?",
        "answer": "In a nutshell, YAML was chosen because it's more human-readable and human-writable than JSON. Despite its cleaner, less verbose and more flexible syntax, YAML also supports comments, allowing you to annotate your resume with notes that won't appear in the final output. YAML's hierarchical structure naturally maps to the sections and subsections, making it perfect for structured data like resumes."
      },
      "howGeneratePdf": {
        "question": "How does YAMLResume generate PDFs?",
        "answer": "YAMLResume is actually a DSL for writing resumes, so under the hood it is a compiler for resumes. It transforms the YAML data into PDFs in a multi-step process. First, it parses the YAML file and validates its structure against a schema. Then, it processes the data with a codegen process that generates LaTeX code. Finally, this LaTeX code is compiled into a professional-quality PDF using a LaTeX engine. This approach ensures pixel-perfect typography and layout that's consistent across all devices and platforms."
      },
      "whyLatex": {
        "question": "Why use LaTeX?",
        "answer": "LaTeX is the gold standard for professional document typesetting, especially in academic and technical fields. It provides superior typography with proper kerning, ligatures, and hyphenation that's difficult to achieve with HTML/CSS or word processors. LaTeX excels at consistent spacing, precise positioning and flexible layout. By using LaTeX as the underlying typesetting engine, YAMLResume ensures that your resume has a polished, professional look that stands out to recruiters and hiring managers."
